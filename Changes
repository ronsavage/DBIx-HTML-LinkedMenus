1.07  Tue Jan 18 22:14:00 2005
	- Add new parameters to new(): base_prompt, base_value, linked_prompt and linked_value
		which allow you to specify strings, and their corresponding values, to be output
		at the top of the 2 menus. The default behaviour is identical to the previous version.
		See examples/test-linked-menus.cgi. Original patch by Sean McKenna
	- Update docs
	- Update examples/test-linked-menus.cgi
	- Note: Originally I omitted such options because I thought these values should always come
		from the database, but this change just gives you another way to do it. In fact, this
		way is neater since you can supply strings which you would not normally have in the
		database in the first place

1.06  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Delete ./test.pl

	- No source code changes in this version
	- Clarify the docs as to what linked menus are

1.04  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.03  Wed Dec 11 11:41:13 2002
	- Minor documentation changes - no need to upgrade
