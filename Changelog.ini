[V 1.07]
Date=2005-01-18T22:14:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add new parameters to new(): base_prompt base_value linked_prompt and linked_value
which allow you to specify strings and their corresponding values to be output
at the top of the 2 menus. The default behaviour is identical to the previous version.
See examples/test-linked-menus.cgi. Original patch by Sean McKenna
- Update docs
- Update examples/test-linked-menus.cgi
- Note: Originally I omitted such options because I thought these values should always come
from the database but this change just gives you another way to do it. In fact this
way is neater since you can supply strings which you would not normally have in the
database in the first place

[V 1.04]
Date=2003-03-23T11:29:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No source code changes in this version
- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros because the
PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro
which means it does not index the module and this in turn means
the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list etc.
